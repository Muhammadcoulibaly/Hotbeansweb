I am definitely happy with my decision to apply to Hot Beans Web and to get the job. The reason of this is that I have learnt a lot from working at Hot Beans Web that I did not know about before, I have also been able to take many more courses which have improved the way that I make websites. Another reason that it is a great job is that everyone respects each other and your opinion which makes it enjoyable to work for Hot Beans Web..</p>

                  <p class="card-text">I have been working for Hot Beans Web since 2008 when I started off as a junior web developer. From the first day I very much enjoyed working for Hot Beans Web this is because of many different reasons but the most prominent one is that all the other members of staff were inviting to me and helped me if I had any problems and I still find that any member of staff you can talk to or ask for help with anything that you need help with either work related or not work related.
